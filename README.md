## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

If you're interested in using this setup, here's a detailed guide. Please note that this is a highly personalized configuration, and you may need to adjust paths and settings to fit your specific system and preferences.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following essential tools installed on your system:

*   **Git:** For cloning this repository and managing your dotfiles.
*   **Neovim:** Version `0.9.0` or later is strongly recommended for full compatibility with the Lua-based configuration.
*   **Tmux:** The latest stable version is advised for the best experience.
*   **Zsh:** Set as your default shell.
*   **Oh My Zsh:** The framework for managing your Zsh configuration and plugins.
*   **Node.js and npm:** Required for `markdown-preview.nvim` and potentially other LSP servers.
*   **[Any other critical dependencies, e.g., Python (for `pylsp`, `black`), compilers (GCC, Clang), build tools (Make, CMake), etc. List them clearly here.]**

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up your new IDE environment:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Start by cloning this repository to your home directory or a preferred location. I recommend `~/.dotfiles`.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cjanowski/my-ide.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```
2.  **Backup your existing configurations (Optional but Highly Recommended):**
    Before symlinking, it's a good practice to back up your current configurations. This allows you to easily revert if needed.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.dotfiles_backup
    mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.dotfiles_backup/nvim_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) || true
    mv ~/.tmux.conf ~/.dotfiles_backup/tmux.conf_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) || true
    mv ~/.zshrc ~/.dotfiles_backup/zshrc_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) || true
    # Add backup commands for any other files you're replacing (e.g., ~/.gitconfig, ~/.config/alacritty)
    ```

3.  **Symlink the configuration files:**
    This setup uses symbolic links to connect the configuration files from this repository to their standard locations in your home directory.

    ```bash
    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/nvim ~/.config/nvim
    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc
    # Add symlinks for any other configuration files you have in this repo (e.g., ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig)
    ```
    *(**Note:** Adjust `~/.dotfiles` if you cloned the repository to a different path.)*

4.  **Install Neovim plugins:**
    Open Neovim for the first time. Your plugin manager (likely Lazy.nvim, as per `lazy.lua` in your `nvim/lua/configs/`) should automatically prompt you to install plugins. If not, run the command `:Lazy sync` inside Neovim.

5.  **Install Zsh plugins/themes:**
    If you're using Oh My Zsh or a similar framework, follow its specific instructions to install themes and plugins. For example, Oh My Zsh typically handles this automatically when you source your `~/.zshrc`.

6.  **Restart your terminal:**
    After symlinking and installing, it's crucial to restart your terminal emulator or source your `~/.zshrc` (`source ~/.zshrc`) to ensure all changes take effect.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts/Commands and Keys

This section outlines some of the most frequently used keybindings and commands across Neovim, Tmux, and Zsh to help you navigate and utilize this setup efficiently.

### Neovim Keybindings

My Neovim configuration uses `<leader>` (which is usually `Space` by default in NvChad) for many custom mappings.

| Keybinding        | Description                               |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `;`               | Enter command mode                        |
| `jk`              | Exit insert mode (faster than `Esc`)      |
| `<leader>n`       | Toggle NERDTree file explorer             |
| `<C-p>`           | Select previous item (in completion)      |
| `<C-n>`           | Select next item (in completion)          |
| `<C-d>`           | Scroll documentation down (in completion) |
| `<C-f>`           | Scroll documentation up (in completion)   |
| `<C-Space>`       | Trigger completion                        |
| `<C-e>`           | Close completion window                   |
| `<CR>`            | Confirm selected completion item          |
| `<Tab>`           | Select next completion item or expand snippet |
| `<S-Tab>`         | Select previous completion item or jump back in snippet |
| `:MarkdownPreview`| Start live Markdown preview               |
| `:MarkdownPreviewStop`| Stop live Markdown preview              |
| `:Obsession`      | Save current session                      |
| `:Obsess`         | Save current session (alias)              |
| `:Image`          | View image file                           |
| `:Lazy sync`      | Install/update Neovim plugins             |

### Tmux Keybindings

The default Tmux prefix is `Ctrl-b`. All commands below assume you press `Ctrl-b` first.

| Keybinding        | Description                               |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl-b`          | Send prefix (if pressed twice)            |
| `\|`              | Split window horizontally                 |
| `-`               | Split window vertically                   |
| `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` | Navigate between panes                    |
| `Ctrl-o`          | Toggle between last two panes               |
| `Ctrl-d`          | Detach from session                       |
| `Ctrl-a`          | Send prefix to all panes in the current window |
| `resize-pane`     | Resize pane (use arrow keys after)        |
| `resize-pane -R 15`     | Shiftpane right 15 units        |
| `mouse`           | Enable mouse mode for pane/window selection |

### Zsh Aliases

These are some convenient aliases defined in your `.zshrc`:

| Alias             | Command                                   | Description                               |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `python`          | `python3`                                 | Use `python3` as the default Python interpreter |
| `pip`             | `pip3`                                    | Use `pip3` as the default pip command     |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

This setup is a robust starting point, but it's designed to be easily customizable to your personal preferences and workflow. Dive into the configuration files and make it truly your own!

*   **Neovim:**
    *   Explore the `nvim/lua/` directory for the core configuration files.
    *   Add or remove plugins by editing `nvim/lua/plugins/init.lua`.
    *   Adjust keybindings to your liking in `nvim/lua/mappings.lua`.
    *   Modify general editor options in `nvim/lua/options.lua`.
    *   Check `nvim/lua/autocmds.lua` for automated commands and `nvim/lua/configs/` for specific plugin configurations (e.g., `cmp.lua`, `lspconfig.lua`).
*   **Tmux:** Edit `tmux.conf` to change keybindings, customize the status line, or add Tmux plugins.
*   **Zsh:** Modify `zshrc` to add new aliases, functions, or integrate additional Zsh plugins.
